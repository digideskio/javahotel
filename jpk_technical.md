# Configuration file

Sample configuration file is available [here](https://github.com/stanislawbartkowski/javahotel/blob/jpk/sample/conf/jpk.properties). Following properties should be defined.

- conf : Directory containing a set of artifacts necessary to run the solution. Sample directory is available [here](https://github.com/stanislawbartkowski/javahotel/tree/jpk/sample/conf).
  * JPKMFTest-klucz publiczny do szyfrowania.pem :  Public key to encode the symmetric key
  * imitupload-enveloped-pattern.xml : Pattern for creating InitUpload XML file used to initiate the data transmition. The file contains a number of position markers to be replaced by current values. I found this solution more applicable then creating XML file on the fly.
  * log.conf : JUL logging configuration. FileHandler is added automatically, only ConsoleLogger should be defined here.
  * test-e-dokumenty.mf.gov.pl_ssl.crt : Certificate used to authorize access to the public gateway.
- workdir : Working directory to keep temporary data between different phases of data transmission. It is  also a place to keep a log file. This directory is cleaned at the beginning of the first phase,  so it is a responsibility of solution user to backup this directory.
- publickey : The name of the file with a public key in conf directory.
- cert : The name of the certificate file (X.509) in conf directory.
- url : The URL to send InitUpload.xml file, transfer initialization.
- finish : The URL to signal the transmission completion.
- get : The URL to receive UPO (UrzÄ™dowe Potwierdzenie Odbioru), Official Receipt Confirmation.

#Preparing initial data

During this step InitUpload.xml file is created and input financial data are zipped and encrypted. Preparing UnitUpload.xml requires several steps like generating the symmetric key, making MD5 and HASH-256 hash for symmetric key and input data. The procedure is described in comments embedded in [source code](https://github.com/stanislawbartkowski/javahotel/blob/jpk/src/org/transform/jpk/JPK.java).

API method : [JPK.Prepare](https://github.com/stanislawbartkowski/javahotel/blob/jpk/src/org/transform/jpk/JPK.java) method.

Command line: [Transform.main](https://github.com/stanislawbartkowski/javahotel/blob/jpk/sample/sh/runtransform.sh) method.

#Uploading data to gateway
This step uses InitUploadSigned, PutBlob and FinishUpload REST API methods.
API method: [UPLOAD.upload](https://github.com/stanislawbartkowski/javahotel/blob/jpk/src/org/transform/jpk/UPLOAD.java) method.
Command line: [Upload.main](https://github.com/stanislawbartkowski/javahotel/blob/jpk/sample/sh/runupload.sh) method.
